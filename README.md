# SCION tutorials page

The website is deployed on [Github Pages](https://netsec-ethz.github.io/scion-tutorials/).

## About

SCION tutorial pages are written in markdown and they are placed in the `content` directory. The HTML website is generated using [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/).

The generated HTML website is placed in the `docs` directory.

## Building pages

In order to build the website you will need to install [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/). 
Also, the `pygments` package should be installed to enable syntax highlighting
of code snippets in the tutorials.
Note that different versions of mkdocs can generating rather different output. 
To avoid this issue, prefer to use a virtual python environment and use the
`requirements.txt` file to install the exact versions of the python packages.

```shell
virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python2.7 venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

In order to generate the website just run in the activated virtualenv:

```shell
mkdocs build
```

The newly generated website will be placed in the `docs` directory.

During the development phase, it is possible to run a local webserver and automatically refresh the website content. To do this, run:

```shell
mkdocs serve
```

## Adding new page

Adding a new page consists of 2 steps:

1. Add a new markdown file in the `content` directory with the page's content
2. Add page information into the corresponding category with description in `mkdocs.yml` (at the end of the file)

## mkdocs-material customisation

The `mkdocs-material` theme is used for the SCION tutorials page.
To change the color palette used in this theme, the source code has to be edited (https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material/issues/874).

Therefore the mkdocs-material source code was added as a git *subtree*, so we can add commits on top:

    $ git subtree add -P mkdocs-material --squash https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material.git 3.0.4

Currently, the following customisations have been applied to the theme:

  * Change primary/accent colors
  * Set favicon
  * Set font size and margin for title in navigation-panel
  * Remove next/previous navigation links in footer

Using git subtree will (hopefully) allow to update to newer versions of mkdocs-material if necessary, by running e.g.

    $ git subtree pull -P mkdocs-material --squash https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material.git <tag>

After updating the mkdocs-material version and re-applying the customisations, the theme has to be rebuilt; you'll need `nodejs>=8` and `npm` installed, then simply run `make` and check in the rebuilt `mkdocs-material/material` folder.

## Check links

You can always look for broken links in the tutorials by running:

```shell
wget --spider -r -nd -nv -l 3 -w 0 -o - https://netsec-ethz.github.io/scion-tutorials/ | grep -B1 'broken link!'
```

Prior to merge to master it is always nice to check against our own repository. For that you need to enable Github Pages in your clone of `scion-tutorials`, and remembering that Github Pages are available only for the master branch, your commits would have to be pushed to your master. E.g.:

```shell
git push myremotename HEAD:master
sleep 30
wget --spider -r -nd -nv -l 3 -w 0 -o - https://mygithubusername.github.io/scion-tutorials/ | grep -B1 'broken link!'
```
