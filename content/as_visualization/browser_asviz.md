# Browser AS Visualizations

## Starting the Visualization
After [updating the latest source code and starting the server](../as_visualization/running_asviz.md), point your browser to <a href="http://127.0.0.1:8000" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:8000</a> to launch the AS Visualization. Even if you run SCION-viz within a VM, you can use the regular browser on your host operating system (Mac or Windows).

Then, enter the "Source AS" ISD-AS pair of your AS. You can find out your ISD and AS number as described in the tutorial [Fetching sensor readings or time stamps](../sample_projects/fetch_sensor_readings.md). Press "Request Data" to fetch updated data.

## Viewing the SCION Daemon
The "Data" pull-down menu option "sciond socket" will bind to a socket to communicate with the SCION Daemon. Alternately, you can override the default IP address of the Daemon by entering the address you wish to bind to in the "SCIOND IP Address" text box.

### SCIOND Paths
Enter the "Destination AS" ISD-AS pair and the maximum number of paths to retrieve in "Max Paths" and press "Update Paths" to view all announced paths to the destination from the source.
The announced paths will be displayed in a combined topology in the window.
To view the details of a specific path expand the path's data by clicking on the path number in the window on right side.
