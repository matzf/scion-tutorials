# Run SCION and SCION-viz automatically on boot

## Prerequisites

It is necessary to have SCION successfully installed on your system before proceeding with this tutorial. Necessary steps for installing SCION can be found on following pages:

- [Installing SCION on Ubuntu x86-64](../native_setup/ubuntu_x86_build.md)
- [Installing SCION on Raspberry PI Ubuntu](../native_setup/rpi_ubuntu.md)

!!! tip
    If you are using SCION VM, SCION is already running on system boot so following steps are not required to be done manually.

## Installation

We will create [systemd](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/) service that will be configured to run SCION infrastructure on system boot.

### Step One - Get template service files

To avoid creating service files from scratch, we can download templates from [SCION Lab](https://github.com/netsec-ethz/scion-coord/tree/master/vagrant) repository and customize them for current system. Downloaded template files have value `_USER_` instead of real system user so we will have to adjust it. Complete process can be finished with following commands:

```shell
mkdir -p /tmp/scion_services
cd /tmp/scion_services

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/netsec-ethz/scion-coord/master/vagrant/scion.service
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/netsec-ethz/scion-coord/master/vagrant/scion-viz.service

sed -i "s/_USER_/$USER/g" *.service
```

### Step Two - Register services with systemd

We need to copy newly created services to systemd directory and enable them. This can be done with following commands:

```shell
sudo cp *.service /etc/systemd/system/

sudo systemctl enable scion.service
sudo systemctl enable scion-viz.service
```

## Conclusion

These steps should be sufficient to make SCION run on your system boot. Reboot the system and verify that everything works as expected.
